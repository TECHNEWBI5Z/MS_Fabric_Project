Data Pipeline on Microsoft Fabric

This repository provides the implementation and architecture of a data pipeline built entirely on Microsoft Fabric. Microsoft Fabric is a comprehensive data platform that seamlessly integrates data engineering, data science, analytics, real-time automation, and business intelligence, all within one unified environment.

Architecture Overview

The data pipeline is structured using various services within Microsoft Fabric. It allows for seamless data ingestion, transformation, machine learning, and business intelligence, along with real-time activation of workflows and alerts.

Components of the Architecture

	1.	Data Ingestion (via Data Factory in Fabric)
	•	Source: Data is ingested from external sources, such as the Bing API.
	•	ETL: Data Factory in Microsoft Fabric handles Extract, Transform, and Load (ETL) processes, automating data pipelines and transforming raw data into usable formats (e.g., JSON).
	2.	OneLake
	•	Unified Data Storage: OneLake serves as the centralized, scalable data lake where all raw, transformed, and enriched data is stored. It allows Fabric services to easily access and share data.
	3.	Synapse Data Engineering (Microsoft Fabric)
	•	Data Processing: Data is processed and transformed within Synapse Data Engineering in Microsoft Fabric, which ensures data is clean, structured, and ready for further analysis.
	4.	Synapse Data Science (Microsoft Fabric)
	•	Machine Learning & Analytics: Advanced analytics and machine learning models are applied using Synapse Data Science. This enables predictive insights and complex data analytics to be executed seamlessly within the platform.
	5.	Power BI
	•	Data Visualization: Power BI, part of Microsoft Fabric, connects directly to OneLake to create rich, interactive dashboards that visualize data insights. This allows business stakeholders to view real-time data and analytics.
	6.	Data Activator
	•	Real-Time Actions: Data Activator enables the creation of real-time workflows based on data insights. Automated triggers are set to initiate actions such as sending notifications, starting workflows, or taking predefined actions based on data conditions.
	7.	Microsoft Teams Integration
	•	Collaboration and Alerts: Microsoft Teams integrates with the pipeline to enable real-time alerts, notifications, and collaboration, ensuring that teams are aware of key insights and can take action promptly.

Data Flow in Microsoft Fabric

	1.	Data Ingestion: External data (e.g., from Bing API) is ingested through Data Factory.
	2.	Transformation: The ingested data undergoes transformation and cleansing in Synapse Data Engineering within Microsoft Fabric.
	3.	Storage: Processed data is stored in OneLake, Fabric’s unified data lake.
	4.	Advanced Analytics: Machine learning models are applied in Synapse Data Science, generating insights and predictions.
	5.	Visualization: The transformed and analyzed data is visualized in Power BI dashboards, providing real-time insights.
	6.	Automation: Data Activator sets up automated triggers based on insights from the data.
	7.	Collaboration: Microsoft Teams facilitates communication and collaboration with real-time alerts.

Prerequisites

	•	Access to Microsoft Fabric.
	•	Azure subscription with the following Fabric services enabled:
	•	Data Factory (Microsoft Fabric)
	•	Synapse (Data Engineering & Data Science in Fabric)
	•	Power BI (Microsoft Fabric)
	•	Data Activator
	•	Microsoft Teams
	•	Subscription to Bing API for data ingestion.
	•	OneLake setup for data storage.

Usage

	•	Data Ingestion: Trigger the Data Factory pipeline to pull data from the Bing API.
	•	Transformation and Analysis: Data will be processed through Synapse Data Engineering, followed by analytics and machine learning in Synapse Data Science.
	•	Visualization: View real-time insights through Power BI dashboards.
	•	Real-Time Automation: Data Activator can trigger automated workflows or actions based on conditions derived from the processed data.
	•	Collaboration: Use Microsoft Teams to receive alerts and collaborate with team members on the insights generated.
